## 📚 Skill Development
Recently, I've been focusing heavily on strengthening my foundations in **core Python** — diving deeper into Python fundamentals, advanced concepts, and best practices. I've also been learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to improve my problem-solving abilities and write more efficient code.

In parallel, I've been actively practicing coding challenges on platforms like **LeetCode**, which has helped me tackle algorithmic problems, optimize solutions, and develop a more structured approach to technical problem-solving. This continuous learning reflects a lot of behind-the-scenes growth that may not be directly visible in my public repositories, but it's shaping the way I approach every project.

## 🧪 Python Unit Testing
Alongside building projects, I've been experimenting with **writing unit tests** for my Python code. I believe that writing tests is just as important as writing the code itself — it ensures reliability, catches bugs early, and makes future changes safer and easier.

While these test files and testing patterns may not always be front and center in my repos, this practice highlights my commitment to **software quality** and professional development practices. I'm continuously working toward making testing a core part of my development workflow.
