### 🎯 Testing Philosophy

> **Quality-First Development**  
> Writing unit tests is just as important as writing the code itself — it ensures reliability, catches bugs early, and makes future changes safer and easier.

#### 🛡️ Testing Benefits

- 🔍 **Early Bug Detection** - Catch issues before they reach production
- 🔒 **Code Reliability** - Ensure consistent behavior across changes
- ⚡ **Confident Refactoring** - Make improvements without fear
- 📊 **Professional Standards** - Following industry best practices

> While these test files and testing patterns may not always be front and center in my repos, this practice highlights my commitment to **software quality** and professional development practices.
